### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hannes and currently working in the statistics department of the Hanseatic City of LÃ¼beck as an Open Data Coordinator. In June 2023, I defended my PhD thesis in Applied Statistics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. My research focuses on flexible regression models (especially GAMs and GAMLSS), Bayesian inference (especially probabilistic programming languages), and applications of these methods in forestry and ecology.
