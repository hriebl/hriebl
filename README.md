### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hannes, I recently defended my PhD thesis in Applied Statistics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. I'm interested in flexible regression models (especially GAMs and GAMLSS), Bayesian inference (especially probabilistic programming languages), and applications of these methods in forestry and ecology.
